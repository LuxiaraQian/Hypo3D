Key Takeaways:
> *Hypo3D Task Definition: Given a past 3D scene (e.g., point cloud, top-view image, scene captions, etc) and a context change description, the task objective is to firstly imagine the current scene state after change and answer the questions in the hypothetically changed scene.

> *The benchmark consists of 7,727 context changes and 14,885 question-answer pairs across 700 indoor scenes. These context changes span five categories: (1) Movement Change, involving geometric transformations like translation or rotation; (2) Removal Change, taking away objects; (3) Attribute Change, modifying object properties such as color and state; (4) Addition Change, introducing new objects; and (5) Replacement Change, substituting existing objects with new ones.
